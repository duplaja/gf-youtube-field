# YouTube Field for Gravity Forms

This plugin adds a YouTube advanced field to Gravity Forms. 

## Features:

* Optionally make videos required. Users must complete the video submit / continue the form.

* Bypassing the required video via HTML edits is non-trivial, for most users.

* Non-required videos record what percentage of the video the user watched before submitting.

* Clear visual indicator for users when they've completed the video.

* Automatically pauses the video when the user leaves the active tab.

* Option to set maximum playback speed for the video. Going above this resets playback to the maximum allowed value.

* Able to be updated with Github Updater plugin.
